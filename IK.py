    constantly throws this warning:
    UserWarning: delta_grad == 0.0. Check if the approximated function is 
    linear. If the function is linear better results can be obtained by 
    defining the Hessian as zero instead of using quasi-Newton approximations.
    need to find a way to silence this, or fix whatever it's complaining about
    initial_pose() has the same problem, but it's less conspicuous since it 
    only runs once
